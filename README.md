Adding Designated Historic Cultural Monuments in the City of Los Angeles.

* As of July 2016, there are 1,104 Historic Cultural Moneuments
* Many of these monuments are buildings which the Los Angeles Building Import has completed the City of Los Angeles.
* Tags from the historic data can be added to these buildings and Points of Information can be made for non-building places.

##Data
[Los Angeles City Department of Historic Resources](http://preservation.lacity.org/commission/designated-historic-cultural-monuments)

## Next steps
1. Select any possible tags to use
2. Cleanup and convert the list of places into a csv
3. Geocode the addresses
  - Possibly by joining on the [county's address file](http://egis3.lacounty.gov/dataportal/2012/06/19/la-county-address-points/)
  - Possibly through [OpenAddresses](https://openaddresses.io)
  - Through something else
4. Define import/update strategy
